(** Additional functions. *)

val input_lines : in_channel -> string Enum.t
(** Returns an enumeration over lines of an input channel, as read by the
 [input_line] function. *)

val input_chars : in_channel -> char Enum.t
(** Returns an enumeration over characters of an input channel. *)

val input_list : in_channel -> string list
(** Returns the list of lines read from an input channel. *)

val input_all : in_channel -> string
(** Return the whole contents of an input channel as a single
 string. *)

val print_bool : bool -> unit
(** Print a boolean to stdout. *)

val prerr_bool : bool -> unit
(** Print a boolean to stderr. *)

val input_file : ?bin:bool -> string -> string
(** returns the data of a given filename. *)

val output_file : filename:string -> text:string -> unit
(** creates a filename, write text into it and close it. *)

val string_of_char : char -> string
(** creates a string from a char. *)

external identity : 'a -> 'a = "%identity"
(** the identity function. *)

val unique : unit -> int
(** returns an unique identifier every time it is called. *)

val dump : 'a -> string
(** represent a runtime value as a string. Since types are lost at compile
  time, the representation might not match your type. For example, None
  will be printed 0 since they share the same runtime representation. *)

val print : 'a -> unit
(** print the representation of a runtime value on stdout.
  See remarks for [dump]. *)

val finally : (unit -> unit) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** [finally fend f x] calls [f x] and then [fend()] even if [f x] raised
  an exception. *)
