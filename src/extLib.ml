(* 
  Note:
  
  Since ExtLib is provided for namespace convenience for
  users who wants to keep the usage of the original
  OCaml Standard Library, no MLI CMI nor documentation will
  be provided for this module.

  Users can simply do an "open ExtLib" to import all Ext*
  namespaces instead of doing "open ExtList" for example.

  The trade-off is that they'll have to link all the modules
  included below so the resulting binary is bigger.
